# YouTube Trending Video Analytics 

This project explores global YouTube trending video data to find patterns across countries, categories, and engagement metrics like views, likes, and comments. The goal was to understand what makes a video trend and how viewer behavior varies by region.

### Tools Used
- **Google Colab (Python)** – data cleaning, analysis, sentiment scoring
- **SQL (SQLite in Colab)** – structured queries for insights
- **Tableau** – visual dashboards for category/country trends

### What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset
- Ran exploratory analysis (top categories, views by country, etc.)
- Performed sentiment analysis on video titles using TextBlob
- Wrote SQL queries to dig deeper (like-to-view ratio, top categories)
- Built a Tableau dashboard with filters and charts

### Key Insights
- Entertainment and music were top trending categories
- The U.S. and India had the highest average views
- Positive-sentiment titles often had more likes

### Deliverables
- Python Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Cleaned CSV dataset
- Tableau Dashboard
- 2-page PDF report
